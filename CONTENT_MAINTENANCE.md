# Daily content maintenance

A scheduled Claude session runs once a day to check that the learning content
is correct and to improve it a little at a time. This file is its plan and its
log. People can edit the backlog and rotation; the session appends to the log.

## Each run

1. `git pull`, then `npm ci` if `node_modules` is missing.
2. `npm run validate:content` — must end with `errors: 0` before and after any change.
3. Pick today's area from the rotation: day number = days since 2026-10-19
   (Asia/Bangkok date) mod 14.
4. **Check correctness** of that area by actually reading it: meanings and
   Thai translations, pinyin tones / kana readings / kanji, grammar
   explanations, answer keys (exactly one defensible answer), explanations
   matching the audio or passage, natural example sentences. Fix every real
   error found. Keep ids stable so learners' saved progress still matches.
5. **Update**: make one small, safe improvement in the same area (clarify a
   confusing explanation, replace a weak distractor, add a missing example).
   On Sundays instead take the top unchecked item from the backlog below and
   complete it fully, or a clear part of it.
6. `npm run validate:content`, `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint` on changed files,
   `npm run build`. Only commit when all pass.
7. Append a log entry below (date, area, what was checked, every fix with id,
   the improvement made).
8. **Changes go through a pull request, never straight to the live branch.**
   Start from the latest `claude/toeic-vocabulary-web-gf8mya`, create the
   branch `content/YYYY-MM-DD`, commit everything in one commit, push that
   branch and open a pull request into `claude/toeic-vocabulary-web-gf8mya`
   titled `Content check YYYY-MM-DD · Day N · <area>`. The description lists,
   in Thai, every fix (id, what was wrong, what it is now), the improvement,
   and anything marked "needs human review". Never merge it yourself: the
   site owner reviews and merges, and Vercel posts a preview link on the PR.
9. If nothing needed fixing, still log the check (in a PR as above). Never
   push a change that is uncertain; note it in the log as "needs human
   review" instead.
10. If an earlier content PR is still open, base today's branch on the live
   branch anyway (PRs stay independent); if both touch the log, the later one
   is merged after resolving the log lines.

## Log

<!-- newest first: ### YYYY-MM-DD · Day N · Area -->

### 2026-10-25 · Day 6 · Mock set 4 (Sunday: backlog)

- Checked: Mock set 4, Parts 2–7 (`src/data/fullMockExamSet4.ts`): every answer key against its script or passage, all arithmetic and dates in Part 7, the NOT question, and item counts (100 + 100). Part 1 skipped: it is being rewritten with photographs in PR #2. No errors found; this set has none of the double-answer patterns found in sets 1–3. It has no Thai explanations yet.
- Backlog (Sunday): started HSK 4 vocabulary part 1 — new file `src/data/langs/zh-hsk4-vocab.ts` with the first 100 words (h4-1 … h4-100) in 4 themed chapters (jobs and character; work; travel and traffic; home and shopping), each with pinyin, part of speech, Thai meaning, mnemonic, example sentence, its pinyin and Thai. All 100 were checked against the HSK 1–3 lists in this repo (行李箱 and 起飞 were already in HSK 3 and were swapped out). Example sentences use HSK 1–4 words. Not shown in the app yet: HSK 4 is enabled by a later backlog item.
- Needs human review: a native speaker spot-check of the 100 example sentences and mnemonics. `S4-R7-D2-q4` "She currently works at Harbor Point Logistics" is ruled out only by "my former colleague" — subtle but defensible. Left as is.
