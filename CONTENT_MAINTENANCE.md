# Daily content maintenance

A scheduled Claude session runs once a day to check that the learning content
is correct and to improve it a little at a time. This file is its plan and its
log. People can edit the backlog and rotation; the session appends to the log.

## Each run

1. `git pull`, then `npm ci` if `node_modules` is missing.
2. `npm run validate:content` — must end with `errors: 0` before and after any change.
3. Pick today's area from the rotation: day number = days since 2026-10-19
   (Asia/Bangkok date) mod 14.
4. **Check correctness** of that area by actually reading it: meanings and
   Thai translations, pinyin tones / kana readings / kanji, grammar
   explanations, answer keys (exactly one defensible answer), explanations
   matching the audio or passage, natural example sentences. Fix every real
   error found. Keep ids stable so learners' saved progress still matches.
5. **Update**: make one small, safe improvement in the same area (clarify a
   confusing explanation, replace a weak distractor, add a missing example).
   On Sundays instead take the top unchecked item from the backlog below and
   complete it fully, or a clear part of it.
6. `npm run validate:content`, `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint` on changed files,
   `npm run build`. Only commit when all pass.
7. Append a log entry below (date, area, what was checked, every fix with id,
   the improvement made).
8. **Changes go through a pull request, never straight to the live branch.**
   Start from the latest `claude/toeic-vocabulary-web-gf8mya`, create the
   branch `content/YYYY-MM-DD`, commit everything in one commit, push that
   branch and open a pull request into `claude/toeic-vocabulary-web-gf8mya`
   titled `Content check YYYY-MM-DD · Day N · <area>`. The description lists,
   in Thai, every fix (id, what was wrong, what it is now), the improvement,
   and anything marked "needs human review". Never merge it yourself: the
   site owner reviews and merges, and Vercel posts a preview link on the PR.
9. If nothing needed fixing, still log the check (in a PR as above). Never
   push a change that is uncertain; note it in the log as "needs human
   review" instead.
10. If an earlier content PR is still open, base today's branch on the live
   branch anyway (PRs stay independent); if both touch the log, the later one
   is merged after resolving the log lines.

## Log

<!-- newest first: ### YYYY-MM-DD · Day N · Area -->

### 2026-10-27 · Day 8 · HSK 1

- Checked: `src/data/langs/zh-hsk1.ts` — all 150 words (pinyin and tones of word and example, syllable-by-syllable match, Thai meaning and translation, part of speech, mnemonics and component claims), all 7 grammar topics with every key point, example, check and 56 practice questions, and the full 40-item mock (keys, true/false direction, picture descriptions, explanations, pinyin, item count and pass mark).
- Fix `hsk1-g2-q8`: distractor "你去哪儿吗？" is acceptable spoken Mandarin ("Are you going somewhere?", 哪儿 as "somewhere"), giving two defensible answers; replaced with "你几岁吗？".
- Fix `h1-41` 几: the mnemonic said 几 is *always* followed by a measure word, contradicted by the file's own 今天几月几号？; it now says it is usually followed by one, except dates and times (几月 几号 几点).
- Improvement `h1-137` 很: the mnemonic said 很 always goes before adjectives while its example is 很喜欢; it now says adjective sentences usually take 很 and that it also goes before feeling verbs.
- Needs human review: `hsk1-g5-q2` and the 有 check in `hsk1-g5` use 是 as a distractor although 桌子上是三本书 / 杯子里是水 are grammatical (the Thai "มี" points to 有, so low risk). `h1-13` 喂 is wèi per the syllabus but usually wéi on the phone. `h1-1` 我 mnemonic (手 + 戈) is a folk etymology. Left as is.
